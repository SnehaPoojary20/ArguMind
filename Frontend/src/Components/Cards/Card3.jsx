      <h1>Spot the Flaws: A Beginner’s Guide to Logical Fallacies</h1>
      <p>Sometimes, arguments sound convincing but they’re actually flawed. These hidden mistakes in reasoning are called logical fallacies. Learning to spot them helps you avoid being misled and makes your arguments stronger.<br></br><br></br>
      <h3>1. Ad Hominem (Attack the Person)</h3><br></br>
      🚫 Attacking who someone is instead of what they’re saying.
<br></br>
Example: “You can’t trust her opinion on climate change — she failed science once.”<br></br>

🧠 Why it’s wrong: The person’s past doesn’t prove the argument is false.<br></br><br></br>

<h3>2. Straw Man</h3><br></br>
🪵 Misrepresenting someone’s argument to make it easier to attack.<br></br>

Example: “You want fewer exams? So you just want students to be lazy?”<br></br>

🧠 Why it’s wrong: It twists the real argument into something it's not.<br></br><br></br>

<h3>3. Slippery Slope</h3><br></br>
⛷️ Assuming one small step will lead to a terrible chain of events.<br></br>

Example: “If we allow phones in class, soon no one will study at all!”<br></br>

🧠 Why it’s wrong: Not every small action leads to disaster.<br></br><br></br>

<h3>4. Appeal to Popularity</h3><br></br>
👥 Saying something is true just because many people believe it.<br></br>

Example: “Everyone’s doing it, so it must be right!”<br></br><br></br>

🧠 Why it’s wrong: Popular doesn’t always mean correct.<br></br>

Whenever you hear an argument, ask yourself:<br></br>

“Does this really prove the point?”<br></br>

“Is this fact or just distraction?”<br></br>

🧠 Learning to spot fallacies = becoming a smarter thinker & speaker.<br></br><br></br>
